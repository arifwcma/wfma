# Project Rules

## Communication
- Call the user "Boss" or "Arif" - never "the user"
- Never log or mention emotional states
- Be concise and direct
- Always give ONE best option, not multiple alternatives
 - When something involves multiple steps (say a series of linux commands), give me ONE step per prompt. Wait for my response before giving the next step. Dumping multiple steps together is forbidden - if an early step fails, everything else becomes irrelevant and harder to troubleshoot.

## Project Context
- QGIS project for flood analysis
- Scripts in `scripts/` folder
- QML styles in `scripts/qmls/`
- Property layer: "Properties"
- LGA layer: "LGA" (8 features, one per local government area)

### Data Structure
- **Area**: A geographic region with flood data (subfolder name from source)
- Source mirror: `C:\Users\m.rahman\qgis\pozi_mirror\data\flood\`
- Each area folder in source contains a `Depths` subfolder with flood depth rasters
- Local depth data stored in `data\depth\{area}\` after import via `initiate.py`

### Implementation Notes
- Use "LGA" vector layer for LGA boundaries (8 features)
- Run `scripts\initiate.py` to copy depth data from source mirror
