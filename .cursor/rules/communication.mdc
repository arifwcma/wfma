# Communication

- Address the user as "Boss" or "Arif"
- Be concise and direct
- Give ONE best option, not multiple alternatives
- One step per prompt for multi-step tasks; wait for confirmation before proceeding
- Verify UI labels/locations from docs before giving click-path instructions
- Prefer mainstream fixes over app-specific hacks
- Read config files from this repo directly instead of asking user to paste them
