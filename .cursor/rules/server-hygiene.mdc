# Server Configuration Hygiene

When making changes to server config files (nginx, apache, etc.):

- **Always revert temporary/superseded changes** before moving on. Never leave stale config blocks behind.
- When a config approach is abandoned (e.g. switching from sub-path to subdomain), **proactively guide the user to clean up the old config** in the same step.
- **Track every server file modified** during the session. Before closing out a task, verify all modified files are in their correct final state.
- When suggesting config edits, **show the complete final file** so there's no ambiguity about what the file should look like.
- **Never assume the user will remember** to clean up previous changes. It's the assistant's job to track and prompt.
